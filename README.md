[![Query version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/query.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/query)

Query adds simple tools to aid the use of Ecto in web settings. With it, we can
add paging, scopes, and sorting with ease. At its heart, Query lets us build
complex queries from our controller params.

## Installation

This package can be installed by adding `query` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
